# Evaluation of Effectiveness of Data Encryption/Anonymisation and Creation of improved Safe Data Tool

**GOVERNMENT OF INDIA**
**MINISTRY OF STATISTICS AND PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION**

## Track:
Data Security and Compliance

## Description

The National Statistical Office (NSO) as part of one of its mandates provide high-quality microdata to researchers for research and innovation. At the same time, it is also duty bound to protect privacy of its respondent. To achieve this, NSO releases anonymized unit-level survey data by removing direct identifiers. However, the rise of powerful data science techniques and vast external databases creates a risk of re-identification, where individuals can be pinpointed by combining datasets. The Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2023 addresses this critical issue. It calls for participants to build a robust framework that aligns with the principles of the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2023 specifically, purpose limitation and data minimization. The central goal is to master the privacy-utility trade-offs: maximizing data protection while minimizing the loss of analytical value.

## Expected Outcomes/Solutions

Design the 'SafeData' Pipeline that accomplishes three core objectives:
1. Audit the Present: Conduct a rigorous security audit of NSO's current de-identification methods by simulating realistic attacks to quantify the current true level of re-identification risk.
2. Innovate for the Future: Develop a superior, configurable privacy enhancement module using modern privacy enhancing techniques.
3. Prove the Value: Generate a comprehensive and automated Privacy-Utility Report that clearly demonstrates the trade-offs of your solution, providing actionable recommendations for NSO.

## Relevance to National Priorities or Ongoing MoSPI Initiatives

Aligns with the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 and MoSPI's responsibility to maintain data privacy while releasing public-use microdata for research.

## Background Resources or Datasets
- Sample Microdata
- Auxiliary 'Ground Truth' File
- Current Anonymisation Algorithm
- Benchmark Tables
- Report Template

## Key Features Required

**Risk Assessment Module:**
- Ingests NSO's de-identified microdata and "true" identifier file (for testing only)
- Simulates linkage attacks using quasi-identifiers
- Computes and visualizes re-identification risk metrics

**Privacy Enhancement Module:**
- Implements at least one privacy-enhancing technique:
  - Statistical Disclosure Control (SDC)
  - Differential Privacy (DP)
  - Synthetic Data Generation (SDG)

**Utility Measurement Module:**
- Compares the protected dataset to original using:
  - Aggregate Statistics
  - Distributions

**Reporting & Configuration:**
- UI/configuration file to control the pipeline
- Auto-generated visual Privacy-Utility Report (PDF/HTML)

## Impact Potential

Improved privacy protection, maintained data utility, and policy-aligned data release practices for NSO.
