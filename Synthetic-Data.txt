Synthetic Data Generation Explanation
====================================

Overview:
Synthetic Data generation creates a completely new dataset that is statistically similar to the original data but contains no actual records from the original source. This breaks the direct link between individuals and the data.

Logic:
1.  Profile Analysis: The algorithm analyzes the original dataset to calculate statistical properties:
    - Numerical: Mean, standard deviation, min, max.
    - Categorical: Frequency distributions and unique categories.
2.  Correlation Preservation: In advanced versions, it attempts to maintain relationships between columns (though this implementation uses statistical sampling).
3.  Random Sampling: New records are generated by sampling from the derived distributions.
    - Numerical: Sampled using Gaussian distribution or uniform ranges based on original bounds.
    - Categorical: Sampled based on the probability distribution of original values.
4.  Utility Validation: The resulting synthetic dataset is compared back to the original to ensure it maintains "Utility" for analysis while providing maximum privacy.

Benefits:
- Zero re-identification risk (no original records exist).
- Can generate larger datasets for testing purposes.
- Ideal for sharing data for model training or software testing.
