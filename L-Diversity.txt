# L-Diversity: Enhancing K-Anonymity

L-Diversity is a privacy enhancement technique that addresses the shortcomings of K-Anonymity. While K-Anonymity ensures that an individual cannot be identified from a group of 'k' records, it does not prevent an attacker from discovering sensitive information if all records in that group share the same sensitive attribute value (Homogeneity Attack).

## What is L-Diversity?
L-Diversity requires that each "equivalence class" (a group of records with the same quasi-identifiers) has at least 'L' "well-represented" values for each sensitive attribute. This ensures that even if an attacker knows a person is in a specific group, they still have at most a 1/L probability of guessing their sensitive information correctly.

## Configuration Options Explained:

### 1. L-Value (Diversity Threshold)
The 'L' value determines the minimum level of diversity required in each group. 
- Higher L = Better privacy but more data distortion/suppression.
- L=2 means every group must have at least 2 distinct sensitive values.

### 2. Methods (Diversity Types):

#### Distinct L-Diversity
The simplest form. It requires that there are at least 'L' distinct values for the sensitive attribute in each equivalence class.
- **Example:** If L=3, a group must have at least 3 different values (e.g., 'Flu', 'Cancer', 'Heart Disease').

#### Entropy L-Diversity
A more robust method that considers the distribution of values. It calculates the entropy (randomness) of the sensitive attributes in a group.
- **Formula:** Entropy(Group) >= log(L)
- This prevents "Background Knowledge Attacks" where one value is much more frequent than others, making it a likely guess even if other values are present.

#### Recursive (c,l)-Diversity
This is the most advanced and restrictive method. it ensures that the most frequent sensitive value does not appear too often compared to the less frequent ones.
- It uses a constant 'c' to ensure that the frequency of the most common value is less than the sum of frequencies of the other values multiplied by 'c'.
- It effectively handles skewed data distributions where some sensitive values are naturally very common.

## Summary
Use L-Diversity when you need to protect sensitive attributes (like medical diagnoses or salary) from being leaked within K-Anonymous groups. 
- Use **Distinct** for basic protection.
- Use **Entropy** for better distribution.
- Use **Recursive** for highly skewed data.
