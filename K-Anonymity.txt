K-ANONYMITY CONFIGURATION GUIDE

1. MEANING OF THE OPTIONS

* K Value (e.g., 5):
    - What it is: This ensures that any person in your dataset cannot be distinguished from at least k-1 other people.
    - Impact: If you set k=5, every row in your output will belong to a group of at least 5 identical-looking records. A higher k means better privacy but more data loss.

* Suppression Limit (e.g., 10%):
    - What it is: This tells the system how many rows it is allowed to completely delete if they are too unique to be anonymized easily.
    - Impact: If a record is an "outlier", the system will delete it rather than ruining the rest of the data. 10% is a standard balanced setting.

* Method:
    - Global Recoding (Default): Applies the same change to a column everywhere (e.g., turning all ages into ranges). Most consistent and recommended.
    - Local Recoding: Only masks specific cells that are risky. Keeps more data but looks "patchy."
    - Clustering-based: Groups similar records together first. Best for purely numeric data.

2. WHAT RESULT TO EXPECT
After applying K-Anonymity:
- Quasi-Identifiers (Age, Gender, State) will be generalized (e.g., 35 becomes 30-40).
- Unique Records that couldn't be grouped will be removed.
- Safety Score will reflect how well the individuals are hidden.

3. RECOMMENDED TEST SCENARIO (Using test_inconsistent_data_100.csv)
- Select Columns: Age, Gender, State
- K Value: 5
- Suppression Limit: 10%
- Method: Global Recoding
- Result: You should see generalized Age values and an Output count slightly less than 100.
