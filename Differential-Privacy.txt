Differential Privacy Algorithm Explanation
=======================================

Overview:
Differential Privacy (DP) provides strong mathematical guarantees for privacy by adding calibrated statistical noise to data or query results. It ensures that the presence or absence of a single individual's record does not significantly affect the outcome of any analysis.

Logic:
1.  Sensitivity Calculation: The algorithm determines how much a single record can change the output (L1 Sensitivity).
2.  Epsilon (ε): The privacy budget. A smaller epsilon means more privacy but more noise (less accuracy).
3.  Laplace Mechanism: Calibrated noise from a Laplace distribution is added to numerical attributes. The noise scale is determined by Sensitivity/Epsilon.
4.  Noise Injection: For each numerical value in the dataset, a noise value is sampled and added: Value_new = Value_original + Laplace(0, Sensitivity/ε).
5.  Privacy-Utility Tradeoff: By adjusting Epsilon, users can choose the desired balance between data protection and statistical accuracy.

Benefits:
- Protection against all types of side-knowledge attacks.
- Rigorous mathematical proof of privacy.
- Useful for releasing aggregate statistics or perturbed microdata.
